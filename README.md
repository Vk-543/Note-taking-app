Note-Taking App
Welcome to the Note-Taking Web App! This simple tool is designed to help you easily add, edit, and delete your notes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app makes sure your notes are safe, even if you refresh the page, thanks to Local Storage. You can also scroll through your notes and manage them with ease.

Features
Add Notes: Quickly jot down any notes you need and they’ll be saved immediately.
Persistent Storage: Your notes are stored directly in your browser, so they won’t vanish if you reload the page.
Edit Notes: Need to update a note? Just hit the "Edit" button, make changes, and save it.
Delete Notes: Finished with a note? Easily delete it with a click.
Scroll Through Notes: Got lots of notes? No problem—you can scroll through them to find what you need.
